# CHPclim

Precipitation is one of the most important climate variables. Long term average precipitation helps characterize mean climate conditions therefore is a valuable input to hydrologic and vegetation health models. Climate Hazards Group Precipitation Climatology (CHPclim) is a monthly quasi-global satellite and observation based precipitation climatology product.

This script converts the CHPclim product into cloud optimzed format. The monthly precipitation is provided at a spatial resolution of 0.05 deg and covers the latitude range of 50 degrees south to 50 degrees north.

The product is produced by the Climate Hazards Group, Department of Geography, University of California at Santa Barbara, in collaboration with the USGS Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET).
