# CHIRPS rainfall

Precipitation is one of the most important climate variables. Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) is a quasi-global satellite and observation based precipitation estimates over land, 1981 to near-real time. 

This script converts the CHIRPS rainfall data over Africa into cloud optimzed format and creates associated STAC metadata. The daily precipitation is provided at a spatial resolution of 0.05 deg. Data for Africa is retrieved from https://data.chc.ucsb.edu/products/CHIRPS-2.0/africa_daily/tifs/p05/. The dataset has a lantency of about a month.

The product is produced by the Climate Hazards Group, Department of Geography, University of California at Santa Barbara, in collaboration with the USGS Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET).
