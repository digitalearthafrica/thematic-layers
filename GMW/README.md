# GMW

Mangrove forests are important and diverse ecosystems. They are habitat for thousands of species, help stabilize shorelines against erosion and provide many resources and services for humans. Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) is an initiative to track global mangrove extents, using ALOS PALSAR and Landsat (optical) data. GWM mapped mangroves globally for selected years from 1996 and 2016. These extents can be used as baseline reference to monitor mangroves in Africa.

This script generates mangrove extents mapped by GMW over Africa in cloud optimized rasters at 10 m spatial resolution.

Global extents for selected years have been retrieved from https://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/45. The extents within the DEAfrica area of interest have been rasterized to a 10 m grid in WGS 84/NSIDC EASE-Grid 2.0 Global projection (EPSG:6933) and stored as cloud optimzed geotiff with no overviews.
